# Project Snippet

HarmonAI is a mobile application that utilizes OpenAI's API to generate AI-curated music playlists based on 
the selections of the user's preferred mood and either a singular or multiple chosen genre(s). The app relies
on the power of Flutter as the front-end of the application, OpenAI for chatbot recommendations, and Spotify/Audiomack 
integration for smooth playlist integration.
